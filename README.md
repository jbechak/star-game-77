## User Instructions
Game controls can be found by clicking on the 'Instructions' button in the home screen. During game play, destroy as many TIE fighters and star destroyers as you can. Regular TIE fighters are worth 100 points, and star destroyers are worth 800 points. Sometimes, rather than flyin at you, a TIE fighter will be chasing an X-xing fighter across the screen. If you destroy that TIE FIGHTER, you will receive 1,000 points, and the X-wing fighter that was being chased will fly along side you to help out.
