## User Instructions
Game controls can be found by clicking on the 'Instructions' button in the home screen. During game play, destroy as many TIE fighters and star destroyers as you can. Regular TIE fighters are worth 100 points, and star destroyers are worth 800 points. Sometimes, rather than flying toward you, a TIE fighter will be chasing an X-wing fighter across the screen. If you destroy one of these TIE fighters, you will receive 1,000 points, and the X-wing fighter that was being chased will fly alongside you to help out.
